# Automated Smart Contract Lottery with Chainlink Integration

## Overview
Welcome to the automated smart contract lottery system! This project harnesses the power of Chainlink to create a decentralized and automated lottery experience. Users can enter the lottery by contributing funds to the smart contract, and the Chainlink Coordinator checks periodically to determine if the conditions for a draw have been met.

### Key Features
- **Automated Draws:** The lottery draw is automated, with no manual intervention required once set up.
- **Chainlink Integration:** Utilizes Chainlink for reliable, decentralized coordination and random number generation.
- **Transparent and Fair:** The winner selection process is transparent, relying on Chainlink's random number generation for fairness.
- **Direct Payouts:** Winners receive their funds automatically, directly from the contract.

### How It Works
1. **Entering the Lottery:** Participants enter the lottery by sending funds to the contract.
2. **Draw Conditions Check:** The Chainlink Coordinator periodically checks if the conditions for a lottery draw are met, based on a predefined time interval.
3. **Random Number Request:** Once the conditions are fulfilled, the Coordinator requests a random number from the Chainlink node.
4. **Winner Calculation and Payout:** The lottery winner is calculated based on the received random number, and the prize money is automatically sent to the winner's address.

### Requirements
For the lottery to function seamlessly, it is essential that:
- The Chainlink Coordinator always has sufficient LINK to cover operational fees and ensure uninterrupted service.

### Quickstart
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
